-- Having a program or script print out "Hello World" is a programming 
-- tradition. On the line below, print is a function that Lua gives us 
-- for free. We can use it to print some text to the console. We'll 
-- talk more about functions later on, so don't worry.

print( "Hello, World!" )

-- By the way, when a line of text starts with two hyphens '--', it's a 
-- comment. Comments are just notes added by a programmer to explain what 
-- the code is doing.

-- If you want to have multiple lines of comments, you can bracket 
-- the lines with '--[[ ]]--'

--[[
	This is a multi-line comment for those who like to write a lot!
--]]

--==============================================================================

-- Variables are used to hold a value such as a number or a string of characters.
-- Below, we're creating a variable called var1 and assigning it the value of 10.
-- We then create a variable called var2 and assign it a string value.

local var1 = 10
local var2 = "This variable called var2 is a string!"

print( var1 )
print( var2 )

-- Lua is a Dynamically Typed language, therefore, variables can be reassigned to
-- other values even if the type is different than what was used to assign 
-- it initially.

var1 = "Now, our variable var1 is a string!"
var2 = 20

print( var1 )
print( var2 )

-- If you're uncertain of a value's type, use the type() function to see what it is.

print( type(var1) )
print( type(var2) )

-- Assigning nil to a variable deletes or invalidates it. This is used to let
-- Lua know that this variable is not currently set to any valid value.

var1 = nil
print( var1 )
print( type(var1) )

--==============================================================================
  
-- We can set strings with double quotes, single quotes, or double square brackets
-- for multi-line strings.

local myString1 = "Hello."

local myString2 = 'Hello.'

local myString3 = [[
	Hello. This is a very long string that 
	is declared using double square 
	brackets during the assignment.
]]

print( myString1 )
print( myString2 )
print( myString3 )

-- Be careful though, you can't mix the usage of " and ' together.
-- local myString4 = "Hello.'
-- print( myString4 )

-- While we're talking about strings, notice how we're using two periods ".." 
-- in the print call below to combine two string values together. 

print( "Game " .. "Over!" )

-- This is called string concatenation and it's very useful when printing out
-- information when debugging.

print( "myString1 type is " .. type( myString1 ) )

--==============================================================================

-- You can use letters, digits, and underscores when naming your variables, but 
-- you can not start a variable with a digit.

local var   = 0 -- Fine.
local var1  = 0 -- Fine.
local var_1 = 0 -- Fine.
local _var  = 0 -- Fine.
-- local 1var  = 0 -- Syntax Error! You can not start a variable with a digit.

-- Also, you can't name your variables after any of Lua's reserved keywords:
--
-- and break do else elseif
-- end false for function if
-- in local nil not or repeat
-- return then true until while

--==============================================================================

-- By default, all variables in Lua are global unless you use the local keyword 
-- before them. Global variables are easy to use because they can be accessed
-- from anywhere, but the overuse of global variables can create code that is
-- very buggy. It's best to always put the local keyword in front of your
-- variables so they are restricted to either the script file or a function.

myGlobalVar = 10

local myLocalVar = 20

--==============================================================================

-- Besides numbers and strings we can also create variables of other types such
-- as tables and Booleans. Tables are special variables that allow us to hold 
-- a bunch of values under one variable name. Some languages call this kind of 
-- of variable an array. We'll talk more about tables later.

local myNumber = 10
local myString = "This is a string"
local myTable = { 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 }

print( "myNumber type is " .. type( myNumber ) )
print( "myString type is " .. type( myString ) )
print( "myTable type is " .. type( myTable ) )

-- Booleans are special variables that can only be set to either true or false.

local myBoolean = true
print( myBoolean )

myBoolean = false
print( myBoolean )

print( "myBoolean type is " .. type(myBoolean) )

-- Some languages also allow the number 0, to mean false - but not in Lua.
-- This is because If you set a Boolean variable to a number - Lua will change 
-- the variable to a number.

myBoolean = 0
print( myBoolean )
print( "myBoolean type is " .. type(myBoolean) )

--==============================================================================

-- Lua supports the automatic coercion of types. This is a fancy way of saying
-- that if you try to do math on a string variable that can be safely converted 
-- to a number - Lua will use the string just like a regular number.

local myNumber = 6
local myString = "6"
local sum = myNumber + myString

-- The following will print 12
print( sum )

-- Be careful though, if the string can not be converted to an actual number 
-- the Lua script will crash!

-- local myNumber = 6
-- local myString = "Kitty"
-- local sum = myNumber + myString -- This will crash!!!!!!

-- You can also force the coercion of types by using the tonumber and tostring 
-- functions.

local widthAsNumber = tonumber( "1024" )
local widthAsString = tostring( 1024 )
