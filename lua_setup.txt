Installing Lua on Windows

The latest installer for Lua on Windows can be found here:

https://github.com/rjpcomputing/luaforwindows/releases

Once there, find and click on the link that says "LuaForWindows_v5.1.5-52.exe"
to download the installer.

https://github.com/rjpcomputing/luaforwindows/releases/download/v5.1.5-52/LuaForWindows_v5.1.5-52.exe

Once installed you should be able to run the "lua" command from the Windows 
Command Prompt.

To do this, open a command prompt on Windows by clicking Start button, 
clicking All Programs, clicking Accessories, and then clicking 
Command Prompt.

Once the Command Prompt window opens, you can type "lua" and press enter.

You can also open a command prompt at a particular folder by pressing and 
holding the Shift key and then right clicking on the folder and then selecting 
"Open Command Window Here". This is very useful if you want to run Lua from a 
folder that already has some Lua scripts in it.

Installing Lua on Mac OSX

First off, go ahead and open a terminal on your Mac by going to your 
Applications folder, and then opening the Utilities folder. Once there, open 
the Terminal application.

Now, type "brew" and press enter to see if you have Homebrew installed. Homebrew 
is a package manager for OS X that can help us install other software tools and 
libraries for us.

  $ brew

If brew is installed you should see something like this:

  $ brew
  Example usage:
    brew [info | home | options ] [FORMULA...]
    brew install FORMULA...
    brew uninstall FORMULA...
    brew search [foo]
    brew list [FORMULA...]
    brew update
    brew upgrade [FORMULA...]
    brew pin/unpin [FORMULA...]
    ...

If you don't have Homebrew installed, install Homebrew by copying and pasting 
this into the terminal:

  $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Instructions for this can be found here: http://brew.sh/

Then, use Homebrew to install Lua in the terminal by typing:

  $ brew install lua

Once installed you should be able to run the "lua" command from the terminal.

  $ lua

If successful, you should see something like this in the terminal:

  Lua 5.3.5  Copyright (C) 1994-2018 Lua.org, PUC-Rio
  >

This is the command prompt for the Lua interpreter, which will allow you 
to write and run Lua code in the terminal window. Hold down the "control" 
key and press the "C" key to exit the Lua interpreter and return to the 
terminal prompt.

Installing the Sublime Text editor

You can use any text editor you like for Lua or Corona SDK development, but 
Sublime Text is the official editor used by Corona, so I highly recommend 
it if you simply have no preference of editor.

With that said, the following instructions are only for setting up the 
Sublime Text 3 editor for Lua and Corona SDK development.
